## ABOUT OUR PROJECT
In recent of the study, only the random walk of a single particle is mentioned, so we want to study the random walk of an entangled pair. This corresponds to the interaction of fermions and bosons in the environment.

## OUR MAGIC SOLUTION
We will use the quantum walk as a factor that affects the entanglement of hydrogen electrons, hoping to see whether these two electrons are reduced to a pure state by the environment.
